 * Specifies that the annotated class is a converter and defines its scope.
 * <p>
 * A converter class must be annotated with the Converter annotation. If the autoApply element is specified as true, the
 * persistence provider must automatically apply the converter to all mapped attributes of the specified target type for
 * all entities in the persistence unit.
 * <p>
 * Note that Id attributes, version attributes, relationship attributes, and attributes explicitly annotated as
 * Enumerated or Temporal will not be converted.
 * <p>
 * Note that if autoApply is true, the Convert annotation may be used to override or disable auto-apply conversion on a
 * per-attribute basis.
 * <p>
 * If autoApply is false, only those attributes of the target type for which the Convert annotation has been specified
 * will be converted.
 * <p>
 * If there is more than one converter defined for the same target type, the Convert annotation should be used to
 * explicitly specify which converter to use.
