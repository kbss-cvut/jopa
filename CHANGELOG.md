# JOPA - Change Log

## 1.2.1 - 2024-01-22

- Add API allowing to check whether an attribute value is inferred (Enhancement #141).
- Support multiple inheritance via interfaces in the object model (Enhancement #157).
- Add implementation of static metamodel generator (Feature #79).
- Rework annotation property value storage (Enhancement #175).
- Dependency updates: RDF4J 4.2.3, Jena 4.8.0, OWL API 5.5.0, AspectJ 1.9.17.

### Breaking Changes
- Removed deprecated Sesame driver (was replaced by RDF4J driver) (#120).
- Removed deprecated query execution ontology API from EntityManager/Query. Was replaced by a [query hint](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa/wiki/Query-Hints).
- Reworked storage of annotation property values. From now on, String annotation property values are always stored as string. 
  Previously, JOPA attempted to guess if the value was a URI/IRI by parsing the value, which lead to incorrect handling of values containing `:`.
  Now, only values of **type** URI/IRI (or entities) will be stored as individuals/resources.
- Require Java 11 or later.

- Fix `simpleLiteral=true` not being honored when saving annotation property values (Bug #171).
- Fix an issue with parsing SOQL queries containing selection by identifier and attribute value.
- Fix selection by identifier in SPARQL when using the OWLAPI driver (was caused by missing support for VALUES).

## 0.8.3 - 2016-07-12
- Consistent handling of instances with the same identifier (i.e. the same individual). Only single instance with a given
identifier is allowed in one persistence context. But, persisting the same individual as instance of different classes in
different persistence contexts is possible.

## 0.8.2 - 2016-07-04

    in-memory repository used by the Sesame driver (which is otherwise, due to the Sesame API architecture, inaccessible 
    through the `RepositoryProvider`.

## 0.7.7 - 2016-05-11
- Added the possibility to generate only vocabulary using OWL2Java, without the Java object model itself.

## 0.7.6 - 2016-04-15
- Added support for plain identifiers as values of Annotation and Object properties
    - E.g. when an entity has an object property pointing to another individual, but that individual is not mapped by any class in the object model, its URI can now be used as the property value

## 0.7.5 - 2016-03-31
- Use xsd:int for mapping Java Integer/int values to RDF. Most Java implementations (including JAXB) do it this way.

## 0.7.4 - 2016-03-21
- Implemented support for typed @Properties fields (i.e. @Properties field can now be a `Map<URI, Set<Object>>`, where values have corresponding types instead of plain strings)
